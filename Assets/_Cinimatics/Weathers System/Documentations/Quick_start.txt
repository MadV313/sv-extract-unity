 Setup Guide - Advanced Weather System

 🚀 Quick Setup (1 Minute)

Step 1: Import & Basic Setup
    1. Import the Weather System package into your HDRP project
    2. Create an empty GameObject and name it "Weather Manager"
    3. Add the `CycleManager` script to this GameObject

Step 2: Lighting Setup
    1. Sun Light:
        - Create a Directional Light (or use existing)
        - Set Type to "Sun" in HDRP settings
        - Assign to "Sun Light" field in CycleManager

    2. Moon Light:
        - Create another Directional Light
        - Set lower intensity (around 0.1-0.5)
        - Assign to "Moon Light" field in CycleManager

Step 3: Volume Setup

    Cloud Volume
    
    1. Create > Volume > Global Volume
    2. Name it "Cloud Volume"
    3. In Volume component:
    - Mode: Global
    - Priority: 1
    4. Click "New" to create new Volume Profile
    5. Add Override > Lighting > Volumetric Clouds
    6. Assign this volume to "Cloud Volume" field in CycleManager
    

    Sky Volume
    
    1. Create > Volume > Global Volume
    2. Name it "Sky Volume"  
    3. In Volume component:
    - Mode: Global
    - Priority: 2
    4. Click "New" to create new Volume Profile
    5. Add Override > Sky > Physically Based Sky
    6. Assign this volume to "Sky Volume" field in CycleManager


Step 4: Particle Systems (Optional)
    1. Rain Particles:
        - Create particle system for rain
        - Set emission rate to 0 initially
        - Assign to "Rain Particles" field

    2. Snow Particles:
        - Create particle system for snow
        - Set emission rate to 0 initially
        - Assign to "Snow Particles" field

    3. Lightning Particles:
        - Create particle system for lightning
        - Set emission rate to 0 initially
        - Assign to "Lightning Particles" field

Step 5: Test Configuration
    1. Press Play
    2. Adjust "Current Time" slider to see day/night transition
    3. Change "Current Weather" dropdown to test weather effects
    4. Verify sky darkens during thunderstorms

🔧 Advanced Configuration

    Fine-tuning Sky Exposure
    - Normal Sky Exposure: 12-15 (bright day)
    - Storm Sky Exposure: 6-10 (dark storm)
    - Sky Transition Speed: 1-3 (smooth changes)

    Optimizing Performance
    - Enable "Low Particle Mode" for mobile
    - Use "Simplified Weather Intensity" 
    - Consider "Disable Cloud Updates" for very low-end devices

    Customizing Weather Patterns
    Adjust seasonal probabilities:
    - Spring: More rain, less snow
    - Summer: More thunderstorms, no snow
    - Autumn: Balanced weather
    - Winter: More snow, less rain

⚡ Common Issues & Solutions

    Issue: Sky doesn't darken during storms
    Solution: 
    - Ensure Sky Volume has Physically Based Sky override
    - Check exposure values are significantly different
    - Verify Sky Volume is assigned in inspector

    Issue: Particles don't appear
    Solution:
    - Check particle systems are assigned
    - Verify they're not disabled or have emission rate 0
    - Ensure materials are assigned to particle renderers

    Issue: Performance problems
    Solution:
    - Enable performance optimization flags
    - Reduce particle emission rates
    - Consider using fewer weather types

📱 Mobile Optimization

    For mobile devices:
    1. Enable "Low Particle Mode"
    2. Set "Simplified Weather Intensity" to true
    3. Reduce cloud densities by 20-30%
    4. Use simpler particle effects
    5. Consider fewer simultaneous weather effects
